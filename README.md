API keys
We didn't get access to an PROD API key but if you have one you can provide it by  putting the following in the gradle.properties file in your user home or project home: 

```
FDJ_TSDB_API_KEY= "<insert>"
```

On Linux/Mac that file is typically found at `~/.gradle/gradle.properties` or in the project directory `KataFDJ/gradle.properties`
